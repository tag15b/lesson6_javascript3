### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I actually learned how to add images and create a photo gallery. This is something I always wanted to learn because sometimes you want to just add a slideshow/gallery to your website and I always wonder how to go about. This lesson finally showed me the way.
2. I learned how to create figure and img nodes, a feature to the Photo Gallery App that will let people add two extra pictures to the screen so all images will be in the slideshow at once and use the designated arrows to any image they want to look at. 
3. I learned how to clone nodes instead of writing and writing the node over and over again. This feature is great so you don't mess up your pre-existing work just clone the nods you need.
